In addition to providing a standardized process flow, it (1) identifies the incident response (IR) stakeholders and establishes their roles and responsibilities; (2) describes incident triggering sources, incident types, and incident severity levels; and (3) includes requirements for annual testing, post-incident lessons-learned activities, and collection of IR metrics for use in gauging IR effectiveness. The goals of IR, as outlined in this standard, are to: Confirm whether an incident occurred; Provide a defined incident notification process; Promote the accumulation and documentation of accurate information; Establish controls for proper retrieval and handling of evidence; Contain the incident and stop any unwanted activity quickly and efficiently; Minimize disruption to network operations; Provide accurate reports and useful recommendations to management; and Prevent and/or mitigate future incidents from occurring. 2.0 Authority [Organization Information] 3.0 Scope [Scope needed] 4.0 Information Statement IR Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities In order to respond effectively to a computer security incident, it is critical that all IR stakeholders fully understand not only their roles and responsibilities in the IR process, but also the roles and responsibilities of each IR stakeholder.  This is necessary to (1) avoid duplication of effort; (2) minimize procedural gaps that may occur; and (3) ensure rapid response to computer security incidents. IR stakeholders include: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) \u2013 The CISO, or his/her designee, provides for overall coordination of IR including the escalation of an incident.  The CISO leads incident response services for the organization. Entity Leadership - Provides mainly IR oversight, with their Information Security Officer (ISO) or designee, being the most \u2018hands-on\u2019 in terms of IR management activities. Security Operations Center \u2013 The Security Operations (SOC) Center serves as a central group for detection, analysis, tracking, response to and reporting of cyber threats and incidents.  The SOC responds to incidents by providing hands-on technical IR and will recommend steps for staff to remediate and mitigate such that it reduces the likelihood of future incidents. In addition, the SOC facilitates collaboration and information sharing with other entities that may be experiencing the same or similar incidents, to help resolve the problem more quickly than if done separately.  The SOC collects information on the types of vulnerabilities that are being exploited and the frequency of attacks and shares preventative information to help other organizations protect themselves from similar attacks.",

All affected systems within the enterprise should be identified so that containment (and eradication and recovery) is effective and complete. Incident containment involves \u2018stopping the bleeding\u2019 and preventing the incident from spreading.  Containment can be accomplished by isolating infected systems, blocking suspicious network activity, and disabling services among other actions.  Containment varies for each incident depending on the severity and risk of continuing operations. Entity leadership makes decisions regarding containment measures based on recommendations from the CISO. Step 4:  Eradication Eradication involves removing elements of the threat from the enterprise network.  Specific eradication measures depend on the type of incident, number of systems involved, and the types of operating systems and applications involved. Typical eradication measures include reimaging infected systems and enhanced monitoring of system activity. Analysis of information collected is an iterative process and occurs/reoccurs during both the containment and eradication phases. Step 5:  Recovery Once the root cause of an incident has been eradicated, the recovery phase can begin.  The goals of this step are to: (1) remediate any vulnerabilities contributing to the incident (and thus prevent future incidents) and (2) recover by restoring operations to normal.  A phased approach is often used to return systems to normal operation, harden them to prevent similar future incidents and heighten monitoring for an appropriate period of time.

    "text": "Finally, it is important to note that the Secure SDLC process is comprehensive by intention, to assure due-diligence, compliance, and proper documentation of security-related controls and considerations. Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources. The extent to which security is applied to the SDLC process should be commensurate with the classification (data sensitivity and system criticality) of the system being developed and risks this system may introduce into the overall environment.  This assures value to the development process and deliverable.  Generally speaking, the best return on investment is achieved by rigorously applying security within the SDLC process to high risk/high cost projects. Where it is determined that a project will not leverage the full Secure SDLC  process \u2013 for example, on a lower-risk/cost project, the rationale must be documented, and the security activities that are not used must be identified and approved as part of the formal risk acceptance process. Note: Data classification cannot be used as the sole determinate of whether or not the project is low risk/cost.  For example, public facing websites cannot be considered low risk/cost projects even if all the data is public.  There is a risk of compromise of the website to inject malware and compromise visitor\u2019s machines or to change the content of the website to create embarrassment. 5.0 Compliance",

A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements.  For example, if a Human Resources unit decides to classify all of their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contains a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls. A narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls.  However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls.  Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets requires a different set of controls for each classification. In the case of an information technology system, such as a database, data warehouse, or application server, while it may be easier to apply a single set of controls as a result of classifying the system as a single entity, costs may be reduced by applying the controls to the individual elements, such as specific fields, records, or applications.  Therefore, it is important that the entity evaluates the risk and cost benefit of grouping a given set of assets. Determining the Information Owner",

Figure 1: Information Asset Identification Template by Single Asset Figure 2:  Information Asset Identification Template by Grouped Asset Information Needed for Determining the Classification Before determining the classification, it may be beneficial for the information owner to familiarize themselves with the following areas: Source, Purpose, and Value: How the information asset is used in supporting business functions. How often the information asset is used. How often the information asset is updated. Dependencies between this information asset and others. The cost of creating and duplicating the information.

    "text": "Example(s):  Information that must be lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records or information that does not need to be withheld for security, legal or privacy concerns is generally deemed publicly available. Examples include public transportation schedules, a listing of local city events, or health improvement guidelines.  These items would be ranked low in confidentiality. Does the information include or contain personally identifying information (PII)? Example(s): A W-2 form contains a name, as well as a social security number.  This would be considered private information and therefore have a minimum confidentiality of moderate, which may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent impact questions. [3] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on health and personal safety? Example(s):  There may be information which, if publicly released, may impact the health and personal safety of the entity\u2019s workforce and citizens such as, the blueprint and drawings of critical infrastructure buildings, critical infrastructure related systems, network configurations, or disaster recovery/business continuity plans. These could be exploited by criminals to sabotage or destroy buildings, emergency services, or critical infrastructure operations resulting in a severe impact to health and personal safety of citizens thereby placing these items in the high confidentiality category. [4] What is the financial or agency liability impact of unauthorized disclosure of information? Example(s):  The entity may be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines due to disclosure of information protected by law or confidentiality agreements. For instance, unauthorized release of vendor bid information containing bidder\u2019s proprietary information could jeopardize the bidding process as well as potentially expose the organization to litigation. Similarly, if the investment decisions of the entity\u2019s retirement system become known prior to their execution, it could alter the market sentiment ahead of the investment causing financial losses. [5] What impact does unauthorized release of sensitive information have on the entity mission? Example(s):  An entity may be charged with ensuring that illegal goods do not enter.  As part of that mission, the entity may be responsible for collecting and maintaining information regarding unmanned border crossings.  If there was an unauthorized release of that information, resulting in an increase of illegal traffic, it could have a severe impact on the entity\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission. An example of limited impact would be the release of employee contact information which may result in additional phone calls/emails/office visits. If a list of local delivery restaurants and their phone numbers is disclosed, there would be no impact. [6] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on the entity\u2019s intangible assets such as the public trust, agency reputation, and public interests? Example(s): It is important for the government to maintain the public\u2019s trust.   For example, the unauthorized exposure of medical records could lead to a loss of the public trust in the entity\u2019s ability to protect sensitive information. An entity which collects and maintains the confidential records of citizens requires a high level of public trust. Unauthorized disclosure of data through the actions of a malicious insider, external hacker, or through a random accident could erode the public\u2019s trust in the SE and their ability to protect citizen data.

Example(s):  Some information generated within an entity is for internal use only and is not meant to be disclosed externally.

Integrity Questions Does the information include medical records? Example(s):  In the case of a health care institution, it is important that medical records and medical history are accurate. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is allergic to specific medications so that they are not administered. In addition, it would be necessary to know whether a person has a particular illness or medical condition which would require special treatment. Malicious or accidental alteration of a patient\u2019s health records  can cause serious health consequences for that individual.  Medical records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.  This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions. Is the information relied upon to make critical security decisions? Example(s):  It is important that security records (e.g., computer security logs, building security access logs) are accurate in order to verify legitimate access and identify unauthorized access attempts.  Security related records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.  This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.

The removal or editing of surveillance tapes may have a serious or severe impact depending on the presence of additional information provided by other forms of surveillance. Something that could be of low to no impact on health and safety would be the unauthorized modification of an employee\u2019s calendars. [4] What is the financial impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information? Example(s):  There are many financial implications for the destruction or modification of information. It does not strictly mean monetary loss, but can also include loss of employee time and effort for recovery. Something that would have severe financial impact might be the loss of all financial records from an entity\u2019s financial management database. If a database of vendor contact information was deleted, it would involve effort in re-creating the database. This would probably be of limited impact. [5] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the entity mission? Example(s):  Entity operations could be drastically affected if information is changed without authorization.  For example, if someone removed all the phone numbers in a Do Not Call registry, it would severely impact the mission of the program to prevent unwanted calls to registered numbers. The mission of a university is to provide education and certify the qualifications of students through academic degrees. Malicious or accidental changes to student\u2019s academic records would have a severe impact on the university\u2019s mission of issuing academic credentials. [6] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the public trust? Example(s):  The public relies on government to provide accurate information.  Failure to do so would erode public trust.  For example, if information on certification for licensed professionals was inaccurately modified without authorization and then posted to a public web site, the public would no longer trust the entity posting the information as a reputable source for this information. [7] Is integrity addressed by law or regulation?  If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information.",

    "text": "Example(s):  Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records, may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws. Allowing unauthorized changes to information may have legal consequences. There are several key statutes that should be examined based on the information asset being classified.  For example, HIPAA requires safeguards to protect against threats to the integrity of electronic protected health information . [8] Is the information (e.g., financial transactions, performance appraisals) relied upon to make business decisions?  If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of that information. Example(s):  It is important for financial information to remain reliable. Unauthorized changes to financial transactions (e.g., direct deposit, electronic funds transfer) could severely impact the financial stability of an entity. Employee appraisal records are used to make important personnel decisions. Someone may attempt to falsify records in hopes of getting a promotion, alternate employment, or to diminish someone else\u2019s reputation and/or record.  The impact to the entity could vary dependent upon the situation. Availability Questions [1] This information needs to be provided or available: As time permits Within 1 to 7 days 24 hrs. per day/7 days a week Example(s):  Intrusion detection systems send event notifications so that an incident can be analyzed and escalated based on the level of threat. Since security is critical, and severe damage can be caused to entity data and networks, this operation is time critical and requires high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week). [2] What is the impact to health and safety if information were not available when needed? Example(s):  Medical records contain information (e.g., allergies, blood type, previous medications) which is critical for providing patients with accurate medical care.  Lack of availability to this data during emergency medical care can lead to life threatening situations therefore placing these items in the high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week) category. [3] What is the financial impact if information were not available when needed? Example(s):  For any entity where online services generate revenue, a disruption of service can have a financial impact which could be deemed severe. A personal computer system crash which can be solved by a simple reboot would have limited impact. [4] What is the impact to the entity mission if information were not available when needed? Example(s):  Public transportation\u2019s mission is to get customers quickly and efficiently to various locations.  If access to train, bus, and subway schedules was unavailable, this could lead to an inability of public transportation to fulfill its mission.  The impact to its mission would be severe. [5] What is the impact to the public trust if the information were not available when needed? Example(s):  Entities have spent considerable effort modernizing operations to include online services and encouraging the public to use these services.  If these services were seriously degraded or disrupted, this could cause serious embarrassment to the entity resulting in a severe impact and an erosion of the public\u2019s trust in the entity and the online services. The availability in this case would be high.",

Any entity may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy. This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other security policies and associated standards.  This policy defines the responsibility to: protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and related infrastructure assets; manage the risk of security exposure or compromise; assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment; identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss or unauthorized disclosure; monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and promote and increase the awareness of information security. Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in today\u2019s highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance. This policy benefits entities by defining a framework that will assure appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data; and assure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures and practices and know how to protect information. 2.0 Authority [Organization information] 3.0 Scope This policy encompasses all systems, automated and manual, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the entity. It addresses all information, regardless of the form or format, which is created or used in support of business activities. 4.0 Information Statement Organizational Security Information security requires both an information risk management function and an information technology security function.  Depending on the structure of the entity, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role.  It is recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.",

    "text": "1.0 Purpose and Benefits Risk management is a critical component of any information security program.  It helps ensure that any risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability is identified, analyzed, and maintained at acceptable levels.  Risk assessments allow management to prioritize and focus on areas that pose the greatest impact to critical and sensitive information assets. This provides the foundation for informed decision-making regarding information security. Federal and State mandates require routine assessments to identify risk and ensure appropriate controls. Risk assessments allow alignment of information security with business objectives and regulatory requirements.  Identifying information security risk and considering control requirements from the onset is essential, and far less costly than retrofitting or addressing the impact of a security incident. This standard provides a risk management framework to evaluate current security posture, identify gaps, and determine appropriate actions. 2.0 Authority [Entity Authority Needed] 3.0 Scope [Entity Scope Needed] 4.0 Information Statement Information security risk management takes into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security controls that are planned or in place.  These inputs are used to determine the resulting level of risk posed to information, systems, processes, and individuals that support business functions. While risk management and related assessment activities can take many forms (e.g., formal risk assessment, audits, security reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scanning and testing), all are aimed at the same goal - identifying and acting on risk to improve overall security posture.",

Options include: Risk Acceptance \u2013 This is a documented decision not to act on a given risk at a given time and place.  It is not negligence or \u201cinaction\u201d and can be appropriate if the risk falls within the risk tolerance level.  For example, entities may choose to accept the risk of an earthquake, based on a low likelihood in the Northeast of extensive damage and the high cost of controls. Risk Avoidance \u2013 These are specific actions taken to eliminate the activities or technologies that are the basis for the risk.  This is appropriate when the identified risk exceeds the risk tolerance, even after controls have been applied (i.e., residual risk).  For example, if a connection between two networks includes unacceptable risks and the countermeasures are not practical, the entity may decide not to make the connection. Risk Mitigation/Reduction \u2013 These are specific actions taken to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  This is the most common approach and is appropriate where controls can reduce the identified risk.  For example, to reduce the risk of network intrusion, an entity may choose to deploy a firewall. Risk Transfer/Sharing \u2013 These are specific actions taken to shift responsibility for the risk, in whole or in part, to a third party.  This may be appropriate when it is more cost effective to transfer the risk, or when a third party is better suited to manage the risk.
