1.0 Purpose and Benefits Entities utilize automated tools to scan systems, computing and network devices, web applications and application code. The results of these scans help inform management and system administrators of known and potential vulnerabilities. Vulnerability management is a process by which the vulnerabilities identified through scanning are tracked, evaluated, prioritized and managed until the vulnerabilities are remediated or otherwise appropriately resolved. Managing the vulnerabilities identified during scans ensures that appropriate actions are taken to reduce the potential that these vulnerabilities are exploited and thereby reduce risk of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets. 2.0 Authority [Authority Needed] 3.0 Scope [Scope Needed] 4.0 Information Statement

1.0 Purpose and Benefits This standard outlines the general steps for responding to computer security incidents.  In addition to providing a standardized process flow, it (1) identifies the incident response (IR) stakeholders and establishes their roles and responsibilities; (2) describes incident triggering sources, incident types, and incident severity levels; and (3) includes requirements for annual testing, post-incident lessons-learned activities, and collection of IR metrics for use in gauging IR effectiveness. The goals of IR, as outlined in this standard, are to: Confirm whether an incident occurred; Provide a defined incident notification process; Promote the accumulation and documentation of accurate information; Establish controls for proper retrieval and handling of evidence; Contain the incident and stop any unwanted activity quickly and efficiently; Minimize disruption to network operations; Provide accurate reports and useful recommendations to management; and Prevent and/or mitigate future incidents from occurring. 2.0 Authority [Organization Information] 3.0 Scope [Scope needed] 4.0 Information Statement IR Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities In order to respond effectively to a computer security incident, it is critical that all IR stakeholders fully understand not only their roles and responsibilities in the IR process, but also the roles and responsibilities of each IR stakeholder.  This is necessary to (1) avoid duplication of effort; (2) minimize procedural gaps that may occur; and (3) ensure rapid response to computer security incidents. IR stakeholders include: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – The CISO, or his/her designee, provides for overall coordination of IR including the escalation of an incident.  The CISO leads incident response services for the organization. Entity Leadership - Provides mainly IR oversight, with their Information Security Officer (ISO) or designee, being the most ‘hands-on’ in terms of IR management activities. Security Operations Center – The Security Operations (SOC) Center serves as a central group for detection, analysis, tracking, response to and reporting of cyber threats and incidents.  The SOC responds to incidents by providing hands-on technical IR and will recommend steps for staff to remediate and mitigate such that it reduces the likelihood of future incidents. In addition, the SOC facilitates collaboration and information sharing with other entities that may be experiencing the same or similar incidents, to help resolve the problem more quickly than if done separately.  The SOC collects information on the types of vulnerabilities that are being exploited and the frequency of attacks and shares preventative information to help other organizations protect themselves from similar attacks.

Agency Incident Response Teams –Predefined teams must be ready which include, at minimum, Executive Management, Legal and the Public Information Officer. In some cases, Human Resources and Labor Relations may become involved. External Entities - In consultation with the Security Operations Center, external entities may conduct hands-on IR activities, such as investigative response activities, or may provide guidance. For example, a security solutions vendor may provide assistance on security appliance settings.  External entities include vendors, service providers, or law enforcement including, but not limited to: Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Service Providers Security Solutions Vendors Data Holder Vendors IR Process Flow This IR process flow covers how to respond to specific situations for IR stakeholders to ensure an effective and efficient response. The focus of the IR process is to eradicate the problem as quickly as possible, while gathering actionable intelligence, to restore business functions, improve detection, and prevent reoccurrence. An entity can adopt the six step IR process flow as depicted below: Figure 4.1 – Incident Response Process Flow Step 1:  Preparation

DOCUMENT TEXT:
The Security Operations Center will establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for IR to reflect industry standards and best practice.  These SOPs will be followed during incident response.  Any exception must be documented. The Security Operations Center must routinely vet and validate the tools and techniques used for IR. In order to operate efficiently and effectively, the IR process must be regularly tested.  This must occur at least annually.  This testing can be accomplished with mock incident training or tabletop exercises using realistic scenarios to provide a high-level outline and systematic walkthrough of the IR process and, to the extent possible, must include all IR stakeholders.  These training scenarios must include specific 'discussion points' that represent key learning opportunities, and incorporate lessons-learned, which can then be integrated into the IR process as part of its review. Step 2:  Identification Identification involves review of anomalies to determine whether or not an incident has occurred, and, if one has occurred, determining the nature of the incident. Identification begins with an event, an anomaly that has been reported or noticed in a system or network. Detection can be accomplished through technical sources (e.g., operations staff, anti-virus software), non-technical sources (e.g., user security awareness and reporting), or both.

During an incident, clear and effective communication is critical.  As such, an escalation procedure should address all lines of communication in the event an incident occurs.  This includes not only internal communication but external communications as well. Communication should flow through all involved IR stakeholders so that everyone has the necessary information to act and carry out their responsibilities in a timely manner.  Notification must be made as soon as possible but should not delay the entity from taking appropriate actions to isolate and contain damage.

Each entity must have an IR escalation procedure that consists of (1) an escalation matrix, (2) an up-to-date contact list with alternate contacts, and (3) multiple communications channels, all in an effort to ensure appropriate and accurate information is disseminated quickly to the appropriate IR stakeholders. Incident Scoping Initial scoping is provided by the entity and includes: Identifying potential targets (e.g., known compromised systems, likely affected systems, key systems); Defining external touch points (e.g., Internet, wireless, 3rd party, remote access connections); Prioritizing likely scenarios (e.g., internal vs., external threat, targeted attack vs., target of opportunity); and Visualizing in-scope environment (e.g., network diagram, data flow). Considerations for incident scoping activities are as follows: Relying on relevant and verified evidence sources; Reducing false positives and volume of data; Avoiding excessive scope and ‘scope creep’; and Realizing operational and resource limitations may affect scope. As additional incident-related information develops during the IR process and as additional stakeholders become involved, an incident typically requires re-scoping. Incident Tracking & Reporting

This step focuses on containing the threat to minimize damage.  It is during this step that information is collected to determine how the attack took place. All affected systems within the enterprise should be identified so that containment (and eradication and recovery) is effective and complete. Incident containment involves ‘stopping the bleeding’ and preventing the incident from spreading.  Containment can be accomplished by isolating infected systems, blocking suspicious network activity, and disabling services among other actions.  Containment varies for each incident depending on the severity and risk of continuing operations. Entity leadership makes decisions regarding containment measures based on recommendations from the CISO. Step 4:  Eradication Eradication involves removing elements of the threat from the enterprise network.  Specific eradication measures depend on the type of incident, number of systems involved, and the types of operating systems and applications involved. Typical eradication measures include reimaging infected systems and enhanced monitoring of system activity. Analysis of information collected is an iterative process and occurs/reoccurs during both the containment and eradication phases. Step 5:  Recovery Once the root cause of an incident has been eradicated, the recovery phase can begin.  The goals of this step are to: (1) remediate any vulnerabilities contributing to the incident (and thus prevent future incidents) and (2) recover by restoring operations to normal.  A phased approach is often used to return systems to normal operation, harden them to prevent similar future incidents and heighten monitoring for an appropriate period of time. Typical recovery activities include rebuilding systems from trusted images/gold standards, restoring systems from clean backups and replacing compromised files with clean versions.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
An IR process is only as good as the ability to execute it successfully.  Lessons learned can be the results of actual IR activities or IR capability testing, and these results should be used to improve the IR process by identifying systemic weaknesses and deficiencies and taking steps to improve on these.  It is important that this take place relatively soon after the incident is closed. Lessons learned, or post mortem, discussions provide (1) a record of steps taken to respond to an attack, (2) investigative results into determining the root cause of the attack, (3) potential improvements to make, such as IR stakeholder training and certifications, process and procedural updates, and technical modifications.  Knowledge gained can be used in an effort to prevent and/or mitigate future incidents in the form of proactive services.  This may include testing the IR process, conducting vulnerability assessments, providing computer security training, reviewing security policies and procedures, and disseminating cyber security reminders. Both incident reports and the results of these lesson-learned discussions will be placed into a database for future use and shared with all IR stakeholders for situational awareness and professional development.

1.0 Purpose and Benefits The purpose of this standard is to list the appropriate authentication tokens that can be used with systems developed or operated that require authenticated access depending on the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). This document also provides the requirements for management of those authentication devices. 2.0 Authority [organization authority] 3.0 Scope This standard applies to authentication of accounts accessing information technology systems for the purposes of conducting government business electronically. 4.0 Information Statement Assurance Levels and Required Token Types The Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) of a system determines the degree of certainty required when authenticating a user. The following table describes the level of confidence associated with each AAL. These levels of assurance are consistent with those established by the U.S. Federal Government for use by federal agencies.

The entity must identify the appropriate assurance level for their system. Each assurance level requires different authentication tokens which incorporate one or more authentication factors (i.e., something you know, something you have, and something you are).  Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) 1 and 2 require single factor authentication.  AAL 3 requires multifactor authentication.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
Entities must choose the appropriate token type(s) for their assurance level from Tables 1 or 2. Table 1 shows the maximum assurance level that can be achieved with a single token type. Table 1:  Single-token Options Entities may use multi-token authentication (i.e., a combination of tokens) to upgrade the overall level of assurance as depicted in Table 2.  For example, AAL3 can be achieved using two tokens rated at AAL2 that represent two different authentication factors (i.e., something you know, something you have, and something you are). Table 2:  Multi-token Options Authentication Token Types Memorized Secret Token A memorized secret token is something you know.  Memorized secret tokens are typically character or numerical strings.  Examples include passwords, passphrases and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs). Typically, a memorized secret token is used on its own for AAL 1. AAL 2 and 3 requires multi-factor authentication.  When a memorized secret token is used as one of the factors in a multi-factor authentication solution, the token requirements at the associated AAL apply.

It is either a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets shared between the user and CSP.  The authenticator is used to look up the appropriate secret(s) needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier.  An example is the use of a look-up secret as a “recovery key” for use when another authenticator is lost or malfunctions. Look-up secrets are commonly used at AAL 1.

An example of an OOB token would be a user logging into a website and receiving a text message or phone call on their cellular phone (pre-registered with the Credential Service Provider (CSP) during the registration phase) with a random authenticator to be presented as part of the electronic authentication protocol.  E-mail cannot be used to transmit the random authenticator for the OOB device. Authenticator Requirements - The device must be possessed and controlled by the user and uniquely addressable.  The authenticator must establish a separate channel with the verifier to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. The secondary channel is considered out-of-band (even if it terminates on the same device) if the device does not leak information from one channel to the other without authorization from the claimant.

Token Requirements - The token must be possessed and controlled by the user, uniquely addressable and must support communication over a channel/protocol that is separate from the primary channel/protocol for e-authentication. Uniquely addressable means that the token can be addressed by a unique characteristic (e.g., phone number). When accessing an application via a mobile device and using a virtual phone and communications management system (i.e., Google Voice), then that mobile device will not be viable as an OOB token as there is no separate channel/protocol for communication of the random authenticator. A limitation with the use of OOB tokens is that if the device is infected, even if the communication occurs over a separate channel/protocol, both forms of authentication (application access and receipt of token) are compromised and all communication is therefore un-trusted.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
A MF software cryptographic token is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are.  It is a cryptographic key that is stored on a disk or some other “soft” media and must be unlocked through a second factor of authentication separate from the authentication factor used to access the disk or other “soft” media. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key.  The token is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message. An example would be a private cryptographic certificate that is unlocked by a passphrase that is separate from that which unlocks the device on which the certificate is stored.  The certificate deployed on the user’s workstation (something you have) in combination with a passphrase (something you know) provides multi-factor authentication.  The password to access the device cannot automatically unlock the certificate.

A MF OTP device is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are.  It is a hardware device that generates OTPs for use in authentication and which must be unlocked through a second factor of authentication.  The second factor of authentication may be achieved through an integral entry pad, an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader or a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port). The OTP is typically displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier as a password, although direct electronic input from the device to a computer is also allowed. An example would be a key fob token in combination with a PIN.  A user attempts to log into a website and provides a user-defined PIN (established when the token was assigned) and a token generated code. The combination of the PIN and token generated code is referred to as a passcode.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
A MF cryptographic device is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are.  It is a hardware device that contains a protected cryptographic key that must be unlocked through a second authentication factor. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession of the device and control of the key.  The token is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.  For example, in Transport Layer Services (TLS), there is a “certificate verify” message.  An example would be an ATM card.

Computer systems and applications are created to address business needs. To do so effectively, system requirements must be identified early and addressed as part of the SDLC. Failure to identify a requirement until late in the process can have major repercussions to the success of a project and result in project delivery delays, deployment of an inadequate system, and even the abandonment of the project. Furthermore, for each phase through which a project passes without identifying and addressing a requirement, the more costly and time-consuming it is to fix problems that occur because of the omission.

Security activities often need to be performed iteratively as a project progresses or cycles through the SDLC. Unless stated otherwise, the placement of security activities within the SDLC may vary in accordance with the SDLC being utilized and the security needs of the application or system.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
Finally, it is important to note that the Secure SDLC process is comprehensive by intention, to assure due-diligence, compliance, and proper documentation of security-related controls and considerations. Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources. The extent to which security is applied to the SDLC process should be commensurate with the classification (data sensitivity and system criticality) of the system being developed and risks this system may introduce into the overall environment.  This assures value to the development process and deliverable.  Generally speaking, the best return on investment is achieved by rigorously applying security within the SDLC process to high risk/high cost projects. Where it is determined that a project will not leverage the full Secure SDLC  process – for example, on a lower-risk/cost project, the rationale must be documented, and the security activities that are not used must be identified and approved as part of the formal risk acceptance process. Note: Data classification cannot be used as the sole determinate of whether or not the project is low risk/cost.  For example, public facing websites cannot be considered low risk/cost projects even if all the data is public.  There is a risk of compromise of the website to inject malware and compromise visitor’s machines or to change the content of the website to create embarrassment. 5.0 Compliance

Responsibility for each security activity within the SDLC must be assigned to one or more security roles. To accomplish this, the default definition of an SDLC role may be expanded to include security responsibilities and/or new security roles may be defined to encompass security activities. In all cases, the assignment of security activities to roles, and the identification of persons given responsibility for these roles, must be clearly documented. For the purpose of utilizing a consistent definition of roles across various SDLC’s, it is highly recommended that entities utilize as guidelines the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications . Of specific relevance to the definition of roles and SDLC frameworks are: NIST Special Publication 800-37 Rev. 2 Risk Management Framework for Informtion Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy

The makeup of a system and software from a security perspective is its security profile and includes the following security concepts, which must be considered and documented as part of a Secure SDLC process. Figure D-1: Security Concepts Information concerning these concepts is publically available at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Cyber Security and Communications sponsored website at https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov. In order to assure alignment with business compliance mandates, and help assure efficient and effective delivery of security services, the use of industry-recognized standards related to risk-based frameworks and secure system development life cycle practices are recommended.

Remote access is allowed when there is a clear, documented business need.  Access may be allowed from entity-issued or personally-owned devices, at the discretion of the entity and in accordance with the standards below. Such access must be limited to only those systems necessary for needed functions. Approved Methods of Remote Access Approved methods of remote access to systems are listed in order of preference. Portals - a server that offers access to one or more applications through a single centralized interface that provides authentication (e.g., web-based portal, virtual desktop interface (VDI)). Direct Application Access – accessing an application directly with the application providing its own security (e.g., webmail, https). Remote System Control – controlling a system remotely from a location other than the entity’s internal network. Tunneling - a secure communication channel through which information can be transmitted between networks (e.g., Virtual Private Network (VPN)). Required Controls

DOCUMENT TEXT:
Most web servers offer the option to store log files in either the common log format or an extended log format. The extended log format records more information than the common log file format. When technically feasible web servers must use extended log format. The extended log format adds valuable logging information to your log file so you can determine where messages are coming from, who is sending the message and adds information to the log file that would be necessary to trace an attack. For systems identified as critical based on a risk assessment or systems that have not yet been classified, in addition to the above, successful resource access events will be logged to include at a minimum: account or user-ID; the type of event; an indication of the event; the date and time of event; the resource; and identification of the source of event such as location, IP addresses terminal ID or other means of identification.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
Information classification is based on three principles of security: 1) confidentiality, 2) integrity, and 3) availability. For each principle, information can be classified as low, moderate, or high. When classifying the impact, the entity should consider how the information/ information systems is used to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Impact levels are defined as limited, serious, and severe or catastrophic. For the purposes of classification, limited impact shall be deemed to include no impact.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
To facilitate the classification of information assets and allow for a more efficient application of controls, it may be desirable to appropriately group information assets together.  A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements.  For example, if a Human Resources unit decides to classify all of their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contains a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls. A narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls.  However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls.  Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets requires a different set of controls for each classification. In the case of an information technology system, such as a database, data warehouse, or application server, while it may be easier to apply a single set of controls as a result of classifying the system as a single entity, costs may be reduced by applying the controls to the individual elements, such as specific fields, records, or applications.  Therefore, it is important that the entity evaluates the risk and cost benefit of grouping a given set of assets. Determining the Information Owner

Responsibility for the classification and definition of controls for an information asset belongs to an individual in a managerial position who is ultimately responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information.  If multiple individuals are found to be “owners” of the same information asset, a single individual owner must be designated by a higher level of management.  The information owner is responsible for determining the information’s classification, how and by whom the information will be used.  Owners must understand the uses and risks associated with the information for which they are responsible and any laws, regulations, or policies which govern access and use.  Each owner must exercise due diligence with respect to the proper classification of data in order to prevent improper disclosure and access. Determining the Information Custodian

An information asset may have multiple custodians.  Based on the information owner’s requirements, the custodian secures the information, applying safeguards appropriate to the information’s classification level.  Information custodians can be from within the entity or from third parties (e.g., another entity). If the custodian is a third party, a formal, written agreement between the custodian’s organization and the entity that owns the information must specify the responsibilities of each party.

Owners must answer the questions in the Information Asset Classification Worksheet (Appendix A) to determine the classification of their information assets.  It is appropriate to recruit and work with subject matter experts who have specific knowledge about the information asset, such as Counsel’s Office and the Records Management Officer. The Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative may also be called upon to advise and assist the information owner in determining the classification.  An entity may add more questions to the Information Asset Classification Worksheet but may not alter or remove the original questions. Information assets are classified according to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each of these three principles of security is individually rated as low, moderate, or high. For example, an information asset may have a confidentiality level of “high”, an integrity level of “moderate”, and an availability level of “low” (i.e., HML).

DOCUMENT TEXT:
An efficient approach towards identifying information assets is for information owners to maintain an inventory for each information asset in their control. The inventory should minimally include the following: Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency) Use of the information asset (i.e., purpose/business function) Business processes dependent on the information asset Users/groups of users of the information asset Owner of the information asset Information assets can be identified using the template provided in Section One of Appendix A or this information can be extracted from an existing information inventory, if available.  Job titles, in place of named individuals, can be used for the custodian, owner, and users in order to ease maintenance of your information asset inventory.  Samples of completed templates are provided below in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1: Information Asset Identification Template by Single Asset Figure 2:  Information Asset Identification Template by Grouped Asset Information Needed for Determining the Classification Before determining the classification, it may be beneficial for the information owner to familiarize themselves with the following areas: Source, Purpose, and Value: How the information asset is used in supporting business functions. How often the information asset is used. How often the information asset is updated. Dependencies between this information asset and others. The cost of creating and duplicating the information. Legal Requirements: Laws, regulations, policies, or contracts that mandate special security requirements for the information (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)). Retention requirements for the information asset. Access Requirements:

DOCUMENT TEXT:
Example(s):  Information that must be lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records or information that does not need to be withheld for security, legal or privacy concerns is generally deemed publicly available. Examples include public transportation schedules, a listing of local city events, or health improvement guidelines.  These items would be ranked low in confidentiality. Does the information include or contain personally identifying information (PII)? Example(s): A W-2 form contains a name, as well as a social security number.  This would be considered private information and therefore have a minimum confidentiality of moderate, which may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent impact questions. [3] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on health and personal safety? Example(s):  There may be information which, if publicly released, may impact the health and personal safety of the entity’s workforce and citizens such as, the blueprint and drawings of critical infrastructure buildings, critical infrastructure related systems, network configurations, or disaster recovery/business continuity plans. These could be exploited by criminals to sabotage or destroy buildings, emergency services, or critical infrastructure operations resulting in a severe impact to health and personal safety of citizens thereby placing these items in the high confidentiality category. [4] What is the financial or agency liability impact of unauthorized disclosure of information? Example(s):  The entity may be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines due to disclosure of information protected by law or confidentiality agreements. For instance, unauthorized release of vendor bid information containing bidder’s proprietary information could jeopardize the bidding process as well as potentially expose the organization to litigation. Similarly, if the investment decisions of the entity’s retirement system become known prior to their execution, it could alter the market sentiment ahead of the investment causing financial losses. [5] What impact does unauthorized release of sensitive information have on the entity mission? Example(s):  An entity may be charged with ensuring that illegal goods do not enter.  As part of that mission, the entity may be responsible for collecting and maintaining information regarding unmanned border crossings.  If there was an unauthorized release of that information, resulting in an increase of illegal traffic, it could have a severe impact on the entity’s ability to fulfill its mission. An example of limited impact would be the release of employee contact information which may result in additional phone calls/emails/office visits. If a list of local delivery restaurants and their phone numbers is disclosed, there would be no impact. [6] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on the entity’s intangible assets such as the public trust, agency reputation, and public interests? Example(s): It is important for the government to maintain the public’s trust.   For example, the unauthorized exposure of medical records could lead to a loss of the public trust in the entity’s ability to protect sensitive information. An entity which collects and maintains the confidential records of citizens requires a high level of public trust. Unauthorized disclosure of data through the actions of a malicious insider, external hacker, or through a random accident could erode the public’s trust in the SE and their ability to protect citizen data. [7] Is confidentiality mandated by law or regulation?  If yes, determine the impact of   unauthorized  disclosure of information.

Example(s):  Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws or regulations. Disclosing this information can lead to civil or criminal liability. There are several key statutes, such as HIPAA, that should be examined based on the information asset being classified. [8]	Is the information intended for limited distribution?  If yes, determine the impact of the unauthorized  disclosure of that information. Example(s):  Some information generated within an entity is for internal use only and is not meant to be disclosed externally. The confidentiality of such information varies considerably based on the information asset. Information, such as system security configurations, which, if released, could jeopardize the security of an entity’s assets, would require high confidentiality controls.

Administrative information, such as procedures for travel approval, though not publicized outside the entity, would be information that the public could legitimately obtain and should be ranked as low in confidentiality. Integrity Questions Does the information include medical records? Example(s):  In the case of a health care institution, it is important that medical records and medical history are accurate. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is allergic to specific medications so that they are not administered. In addition, it would be necessary to know whether a person has a particular illness or medical condition which would require special treatment. Malicious or accidental alteration of a patient’s health records  can cause serious health consequences for that individual.  Medical records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.  This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions. Is the information relied upon to make critical security decisions? Example(s):  It is important that security records (e.g., computer security logs, building security access logs) are accurate in order to verify legitimate access and identify unauthorized access attempts.  Security related records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.  This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions. What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on health and safety? Example(s):  There is a potential for severe impact on the safety of citizens if someone accesses an airline system and modifies the onboard navigation system. The removal or editing of surveillance tapes may have a serious or severe impact depending on the presence of additional information provided by other forms of surveillance. Something that could be of low to no impact on health and safety would be the unauthorized modification of an employee’s calendars. [4] What is the financial impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information? Example(s):  There are many financial implications for the destruction or modification of information. It does not strictly mean monetary loss, but can also include loss of employee time and effort for recovery. Something that would have severe financial impact might be the loss of all financial records from an entity’s financial management database. If a database of vendor contact information was deleted, it would involve effort in re-creating the database. This would probably be of limited impact. [5] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the entity mission? Example(s):  Entity operations could be drastically affected if information is changed without authorization.  For example, if someone removed all the phone numbers in a Do Not Call registry, it would severely impact the mission of the program to prevent unwanted calls to registered numbers. The mission of a university is to provide education and certify the qualifications of students through academic degrees. Malicious or accidental changes to student’s academic records would have a severe impact on the university’s mission of issuing academic credentials. [6] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the public trust? Example(s):  The public relies on government to provide accurate information.  Failure to do so would erode public trust.  For example, if information on certification for licensed professionals was inaccurately modified without authorization and then posted to a public web site, the public would no longer trust the entity posting the information as a reputable source for this information. [7] Is integrity addressed by law or regulation?  If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

Example(s):  Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records, may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws. Allowing unauthorized changes to information may have legal consequences. There are several key statutes that should be examined based on the information asset being classified.  For example, HIPAA requires safeguards to protect against threats to the integrity of electronic protected health information . [8] Is the information (e.g., financial transactions, performance appraisals) relied upon to make business decisions?  If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of that information. Example(s):  It is important for financial information to remain reliable. Unauthorized changes to financial transactions (e.g., direct deposit, electronic funds transfer) could severely impact the financial stability of an entity. Employee appraisal records are used to make important personnel decisions. Someone may attempt to falsify records in hopes of getting a promotion, alternate employment, or to diminish someone else’s reputation and/or record.  The impact to the entity could vary dependent upon the situation. Availability Questions [1] This information needs to be provided or available: As time permits Within 1 to 7 days 24 hrs. per day/7 days a week Example(s):  Intrusion detection systems send event notifications so that an incident can be analyzed and escalated based on the level of threat. Since security is critical, and severe damage can be caused to entity data and networks, this operation is time critical and requires high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week). [2] What is the impact to health and safety if information were not available when needed? Example(s):  Medical records contain information (e.g., allergies, blood type, previous medications) which is critical for providing patients with accurate medical care.  Lack of availability to this data during emergency medical care can lead to life threatening situations therefore placing these items in the high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week) category. [3] What is the financial impact if information were not available when needed? Example(s):  For any entity where online services generate revenue, a disruption of service can have a financial impact which could be deemed severe. A personal computer system crash which can be solved by a simple reboot would have limited impact. [4] What is the impact to the entity mission if information were not available when needed? Example(s):  Public transportation’s mission is to get customers quickly and efficiently to various locations.  If access to train, bus, and subway schedules was unavailable, this could lead to an inability of public transportation to fulfill its mission.  The impact to its mission would be severe. [5] What is the impact to the public trust if the information were not available when needed? Example(s):  Entities have spent considerable effort modernizing operations to include online services and encouraging the public to use these services.  If these services were seriously degraded or disrupted, this could cause serious embarrassment to the entity resulting in a severe impact and an erosion of the public’s trust in the entity and the online services. The availability in this case would be high.

Staff should be sensitive to the fact that information posted on social media sites clearly reflects on the individual and may also reflect on the individual’s professional life. Consequently, staff should use discretion when posting information on these sites and be conscious of the potential perceptions of and responses to the information. It is important to remember that once information is posted on a social media site, it can be captured and used in ways not originally intended. It is nearly impossible to retract, as it often lives on in copies, archives, backups, and memory cache.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for the entity as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any entity may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy. This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other security policies and associated standards.  This policy defines the responsibility to: protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and related infrastructure assets; manage the risk of security exposure or compromise; assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment; identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss or unauthorized disclosure; monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and promote and increase the awareness of information security. Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in today’s highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance. This policy benefits entities by defining a framework that will assure appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data; and assure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures and practices and know how to protect information. 2.0 Authority [Organization information] 3.0 Scope This policy encompasses all systems, automated and manual, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the entity. It addresses all information, regardless of the form or format, which is created or used in support of business activities. 4.0 Information Statement Organizational Security Information security requires both an information risk management function and an information technology security function.  Depending on the structure of the entity, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role.  It is recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
1.0 Purpose and Benefits Risk management is a critical component of any information security program.  It helps ensure that any risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability is identified, analyzed, and maintained at acceptable levels.  Risk assessments allow management to prioritize and focus on areas that pose the greatest impact to critical and sensitive information assets. This provides the foundation for informed decision-making regarding information security. Federal and State mandates require routine assessments to identify risk and ensure appropriate controls. Risk assessments allow alignment of information security with business objectives and regulatory requirements.  Identifying information security risk and considering control requirements from the onset is essential, and far less costly than retrofitting or addressing the impact of a security incident. This standard provides a risk management framework to evaluate current security posture, identify gaps, and determine appropriate actions. 2.0 Authority [Entity Authority Needed] 3.0 Scope [Entity Scope Needed] 4.0 Information Statement Information security risk management takes into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security controls that are planned or in place.  These inputs are used to determine the resulting level of risk posed to information, systems, processes, and individuals that support business functions. While risk management and related assessment activities can take many forms (e.g., formal risk assessment, audits, security reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scanning and testing), all are aimed at the same goal - identifying and acting on risk to improve overall security posture.

determine the risk tolerance, or the level of risk that is acceptable. For information security risk decisions that may affect multiple entities, the lowest level of risk tolerance for those entities must prevail.  It is important that entities recognize how fundamental this decision is to the risk management process. Risk tolerance is an executive-level decision and information technology (IT) staff should not be determining the risk tolerance for an entity. Assess Risk Assessing risk starts with identifying and classifying assets within scope. Risk is assessed by determining the threats and vulnerabilities to these assets, identifying the potential impact of each vulnerability being exploited, and determining the likelihood of occurrence.  A list of potential threats and vulnerabilities needs to be developed, and may come from preexisting resources. It is important to note that the risk assessment process is comprehensive by intention, to assure due diligence, compliance, and proper documentation of security related controls and considerations.

Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources.  The extent of the risk assessment should be commensurate with the classification (information sensitivity and system criticality) of the system/process and the risks this system/process introduces into the overall environment. Types of information security risk assessments include, but are not limited to: Enterprise Risk Assessments – Assesses risks to core agency assets, operational processes, and functions; Physical Infrastructure Assets and Systems Risk Assessments – Identifies and assesses vulnerabilities and risks to core physical infrastructure assets and systems; Project Security Risk Assessments (New Risks) – Identifies and assesses new risks to existing components introduced by new technology or service offerings; and Change Request Risk Assessments – Assesses risk of change to ensure security is not compromised by the proposed change.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
Once risk has been assessed, the entity must determine and implement the appropriate course of action.  Options include: Risk Acceptance – This is a documented decision not to act on a given risk at a given time and place.  It is not negligence or “inaction” and can be appropriate if the risk falls within the risk tolerance level.  For example, entities may choose to accept the risk of an earthquake, based on a low likelihood in the Northeast of extensive damage and the high cost of controls. Risk Avoidance – These are specific actions taken to eliminate the activities or technologies that are the basis for the risk.  This is appropriate when the identified risk exceeds the risk tolerance, even after controls have been applied (i.e., residual risk).  For example, if a connection between two networks includes unacceptable risks and the countermeasures are not practical, the entity may decide not to make the connection. Risk Mitigation/Reduction – These are specific actions taken to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  This is the most common approach and is appropriate where controls can reduce the identified risk.  For example, to reduce the risk of network intrusion, an entity may choose to deploy a firewall. Risk Transfer/Sharing – These are specific actions taken to shift responsibility for the risk, in whole or in part, to a third party.  This may be appropriate when it is more cost effective to transfer the risk, or when a third party is better suited to manage the risk.  For example, an entity may transfer risk through legal disclaimers or by outsourcing to a vendor. Monitor Risk

The entity must ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are in place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and information commensurate with the information classification standards. Methods of Media Sanitization The following table depicts the three types of sanitization methods and the impact of each method. Sanitization Decision Process The decision process is based on the confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. The entities choose the type of sanitization to be used, and the type of sanitization is approved by the Information Owner.  The technique used may vary by media type and by the technology available to the custodian, so long as the requirements of the sanitization type are met.  Recommended Sanitization techniques for specific types of media are outlined in Appendix A of NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.

The cost versus benefit of a sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. Entities can always increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an assessment of the existing risk. For example, even though Clear or Purge may be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and validation, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. Entities may not decrease the level of sanitization required. Control of Media

A factor influencing a sanitization decision is who has control and access to the media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control: Under SE Control: Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under the entity’s control if contractual agreements are in place and the maintenance provider specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information. Maintenance being performed on an entity’s site, under the entity’s supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the entity. Not Under Entity Control: Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where the specific media will not be returned to the entity are considered to be out of the entity’s control.

Modifying Access: Access modifications must include a valid authorization.  When there is a position change (not including separation), access is immediately reviewed and removed when no longer needed. Disabling Accounts/Removing Access: Event/Risk Based (Administrative Disable): When an account poses or has the potential to pose a significant risk, either the account is disabled and/or access attributes are removed upon discovery of the risk. Close coordination between the information owners, account managers/administrators, legal, incident response stakeholders and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution of removing or restricting user access.  Significant risk may include a disgruntled employee, or one who has been identified by as a potential risk. Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations. An account identifier is required to identify these accounts and prevent inappropriate re-enabling of the account/access.  Re-enabling the account requires explicit approval of the entity, Self-service mechanisms may not be used to re-enable the account.
