This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for the entity as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any entity may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy. This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other security policies and associated standards.  This policy defines the responsibility to: protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and related infrastructure assets; manage the risk of security exposure or compromise; assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment; identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss or unauthorized disclosure; monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and promote and increase the awareness of information security. Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in today’s highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance. This policy benefits entities by defining a framework that will assure appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data; and assure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures and practices and know how to protect information. 2.0 Authority [Organization information] 3.0 Scope This policy encompasses all systems, automated and manual, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the entity. It addresses all information, regardless of the form or format, which is created or used in support of business activities. 4.0 Information Statement Organizational Security Information security requires both an information risk management function and an information technology security function.  Depending on the structure of the entity, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role.  It is recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.

This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for the entity as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any entity may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy. This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other security policies and associated standards.  This policy defines the responsibility to: protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and related infrastructure assets; manage the risk of security exposure or compromise; assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment; identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss or unauthorized disclosure; monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and promote and increase the awareness of information security. Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in today’s highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance. This policy benefits entities by defining a framework that will assure appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data; and assure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures and practices and know how to protect information. 2.0 Authority [Organization information] 3.0 Scope This policy encompasses all systems, automated and manual, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the entity. It addresses all information, regardless of the form or format, which is created or used in support of business activities. 4.0 Information Statement Organizational Security Information security requires both an information risk management function and an information technology security function.  Depending on the structure of the entity, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role.  It is recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.
